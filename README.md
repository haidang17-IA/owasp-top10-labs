##  Topics Covered

### 1. **Injection**
- SQL Injection (Retrieving hidden data, UNION attacks, Blind SQLi)
- Command Injection
- Second-order Injection  

### 2. **Broken Authentication**
- Credential Stuffing
- Brute-force login
- Session token issues
- Bypassing 2FA  

### 3. **Sensitive Data Exposure** *(aka Cryptographic Failures)*
- Insecure TLS/SSL
- Data leakage in transit or at rest

### 4. **XML External Entities (XXE)**
- External entity injection
- File disclosure, SSRF via XML payload

### 5. **Broken Access Control**
- IDOR
- Forced browsing
- Privilege escalation

### 6. **Security Misconfiguration**
- Exposed admin panels
- Misconfigured headers
- Directory listing

### 7. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
- Reflected, Stored, DOM-based XSS
- Context-aware escaping and CSP

### 8. **Insecure Deserialization**
- Remote code execution via object injection

### 9. **Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities**
- Dependency scanning
- Exploiting outdated libraries

### 10. **Insufficient Logging and Monitoring**
- Missed detection of attacks
- Lack of alerting and audit trails
